# trip-mock

`trip-mock` is an HTTP mocking library for nodeJS.

`trip-mock` is mainly used to craft e2e/human tests of HTTP services.

# How does it work?

`trip-mock` is made for developers and avoid the use of tons of json files to setup mocks, it offers a comprehensive DSL and a low level api based on [expressjs](http://expressjs.com) so developers can precisely tweak their mock services to their needs where DSL do not cover use cases.

Mocking with `trip-mock` invite you to travel in different vibes!

First of all, you have to define destinations (`endpoints`) you want to mock.

Then define all the `vibes` (scenarios) of your trip.

A `vibe` is made of mocks (mocked endpoints). Definition of mocks are inspired by [nock](https://github.com/node-nock/nock)

`trip-mock` library is bundled with an http server api (also bin script) to run your vibes.

Then manually or from your testing framework you can select the desired vibe and run tests on it, change the vibe and ...

# Install

```
$ npm install trip-mock
```

# 'trip mock' at first glance

Let's say your system is using a CRM backoffice with an HTTP API offering an endpoint `GET /public/v0/people`.

You have to mock this endpoint.

First install `trip-mock`, then add config files below: 

```
// ./endpoints.js

const { endpoint } = require('trip-mock');
endpoint('people', { uri: '/public/v0/people', method: 'get' });

// vibes.js
const { vibe } = require('trip-mock');
const faker = require('faker');
const people = [
  {id: 1, name: faker.name.lastName()},
  {id: 2, name: faker.name.lastName()},
];

vibe.default('Main', mock => {
  mock('people')
    .checkHeader({ 'content-Type': /application\/json/ })
    .reply([200, people]);
});


// trip.config.js
module.exports = {
  host: 'localhost',
  // port: 8181,
  vibes: path.join(__dirname, './vibes.js'),
  endpoints: path.join(__dirname, './endpoints.js'),
};
```

Then run:

```
$ DEBUG=trip* npx trip-server --config ./trip.config.js 
  trip Vibe 'Main' created +0ms
  trip Endpoint 'people:/public/v0/people' created +2ms
  trip Vibe 'Main' is now active +1ms
  trip started on 'http://localhost:33811' +0ms
  trip GET / 404 7.059 ms - 139 +0ms
  trip GET /favicon.ico 404 1.028 ms - 150 +427ms
  trip Endpoint 'Main@people:/public/v0/people' selected +23s
  trip Mock 'people' visited +5ms
  trip GET /public/v0/people 200 5.629 ms - 49 +12s
  trip Endpoint 'Main@people:/public/v0/people' selected +46s
  trip Mock 'people' visited +1ms
  trip GET /public/v0/people 200 1.319 ms - 49 +46s
```

And now:

```
$ curl http://localhost:33811/public/v0/people
[{"id":1,"name":"Mohr"},{"id":2,"name":"Muller"}]‚èé                    
```
Here it is, you made your first trip mock.
